Jeffrey the brown whale is a good bot. He was made thanks to the Red bot, all credit for the initial base programming goes to them, I am just building off their amazing work.

The default set of modules includes and it's not limited to:
* Moderation features (kick/ban/softban, filters, mod-log...)
* Trivia (lists included and you can make new ones!)
* Music features (playlists, youtube, soundcloud, queues...)
* Stream alerts (twitch/hitbox)
* Slot machines (yes, really!)
* Custom commands
* Imgur/gif search
* And much much more
